# Brief
This is the first assignment of the course: Pattern recognition and Machine Learning
The model has to classify 10 characters o from Ge`ez (Ethiopic) languages
Kaggle description: 
"Character recognition is one of the first fields where machine learning was used. Among the first extensive experiments was the MNIST dataset, handwritten digits 0...9 collected from US postal envelopes. Since this classic benchmark collection, a number of MNIST-like datasets have been collected; for example the Fashion MNIST dataset consisting of pictures of 10 different clothing classes.

Recently, the list of MNIST's was extended by Afro-MNIST, a synthetic MNIST-style dataset for four orthographies used in Afro-Asiatic and Niger-Congo languages. This competition hosts a modified version of the Ge`ez (Ethiopic) dataset published in the paper [1].

The competition is part of Tampere University (TAU) course DATA.ML.200 Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning in the Fall semester 2020."

# Data description 
"The data consists of two files: train.zip and test.zip. The former file, train.zip, contains 60000 bitmaps of size 28x28, and is organized into folders 1, 2, ... 10, each containing 6000 examples of the respective symbol. The folders are indeed 1, 2, ... 10 as Ethiopic does not have the digit 0.

The second zip file, test.zip contains 10000 test digits, for which you should predict the respective classes. Each filename in the test.zip refers to the column Id in the submission csv file, i.e., from the file 00000.jpg you should generate a row like 00000,6 into the submission file."
